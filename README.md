### Repository Overview

This repository is about EDA performed on Indian Premier League Data available between 2008 - 2018.
- It has a python notebook where all the coding has been done 
- It also has the relevant datasets used for this analysis

### Brief Overview of the steps followed in this project

There are 2 datasets used for the analysis. 'matches' dataset gives information on all the matches played in IPL between 2008 and 2018 i.e. information on the following:
- Season
- Venue
- City
- Teams
- Winner
- Toss Winner
- Winning margin
- Umpires

On the other hand 'deliveries' dataset gives ball by ball information on every match played during 2008 - 2018. In a nutshell it provides information on the following
- Runs scored per ball
- Extras by bowlers/fielding team
- Wickets taken
- Types of dismissals
- Venue
It basically provides individual records of players. 

The entire EDA process was broken down into 2 high level topics to find answers to the problem statement
- Univariate Analysis (analysing individual attributes)
- Bivariate Analysis (analysing 2 attributes together)

However, before analysing, Profiling and processing of data was undertaken.
After finding patterns and relationships in the data, EDA process was concluded with few conclusions as derived while analysing. Along with concluding insights, few actionable items were also suggested which could help in better performance of players or auctioning of players, etc.
